Project for City College of San Francisco's online course for learning basics in Adobe Creative Suite. Course #VMD105 creating an Internet Cats web site with supplied images and text that we had to match. 
I was able to add a Click for More Information page that was not provided to us. I added links to 1 YouTube video and 2 other sites.
I was able to code a link to the YouTube video on a relevent page into the body of the text.
I also changed the border color and used <br> to reformat where the text breaks were to make it more readable.
