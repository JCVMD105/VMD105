This is a project for City College of San Francisco's online course VMD105, which covered 4 basic apps in Adobe Creative Suite: Photoshop, Illustrator, Animate, InDesign. 

Because Adobe web app Dreamweaver is basically defunct, the teacher taught us coding with html(hypertext markup language) and styling using css (cascading style sheets).

Each module for the 4 applications took 2-3 weeks. The last module is Web Design. The project posted here about Internet Cats is the second of the three to learn coding for web design. We had to create a website with multiple pages. We used Phoenix Code as the text editor application. Images and text were supplied that we had to code to match examples. 

For some variation to the basic project, I was able to add a Click for More Information page that was not provided to us. I added links to 1 YouTube video and 2 other sites.

I was able to code a link to the YouTube video on a relevent page into the body of the text.

I also changed the border color and found out I could use <br> to reformat where the text breaks were to make it more readable.

Coding is not as fun as InDesign or any WYSIWYG software. It's frustrating and has many rules and is not easy to learn.
